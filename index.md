# XLibre Xserver
Xlibre is a fork of the [Xorg Xserver](https://gitlab.freedesktop.org/xorg/xserver)
with lots of code cleanups and enhanced functionality.

This fork was necessary since toxic elements within Xorg projects, moles from
BigTech, are boycotting any substantial work on Xorg, in order to destroy the
project, to eliminate competition of their own products. Classic “embrace,
extend, extinguish” tactics.

Right after journalists first began covering the planned fork Xlibre, on June
6th 2025, Redhat employees started a purge on the Xlibre founder’s GitLab
account on freedesktop.org: deleted the git repo, tickets, merge requests, etc,
and so fired the shot that the whole world heard.

This is an independent project, not at all affiliated with BigTech or any of
their subsidiaries or tax evasion tools, nor any political activists groups,
state actors, etc. It’s explicitly free of any “DEI” or similar discriminatory
policies. Anybody who’s treating others nicely is welcomed.

It doesn’t matter which country you’re coming from, your political views, your
race, your sex, your age, your food menu, whether you wear boots or heels,
whether you’re furry or fairy, Conan or McKay, comic character, a small furry
creature from Alpha Centauri, a neurodivergent or everybody else.
Anybody who’s interested in bringing X forward is welcome, so it’s truly
inclusive!

Together we’ll make X great again!

## Upgrade notice
- Module ABIs have changed - drivers MUST be recompiled against
  this Xserver version, otherwise the Xserver can crash or fail to start
  up correctly.

- If your console is locked up (no input possible, not even VT switch), then
  most likely the input driver couldn’t be loaded due to a version mismatch.
  When unsure, it’s best to be prepared to ssh into your machine from another
  one or set a timer that’s calling `chvt 1` after certain time, so you don’t
  need a cold reboot. Or, make sure that you have magic `SysRq` key enabled
  (`Alt+PrtSc`) via sysctl (`kernel.sysrq=1`), then press following combination
  depending on keyboard layout to make kernel regain control over keyboard to
  make VT switching work:
  - QWERTY/AZERTY keyboard layout: `SysRq + R`
  - Dvorak/Colemak keyboard layout: `SysRq + P`
<p></p>
- Proprietary Nvidia drivers might break: they still haven’t managed to do even
  simple cleanups to catch up with Xorg master for about a year. All attempts to
  get into direct mail contact have failed. We’re trying to work around this,
  but cannot give any guarantees. But you can make it work by adding `Option
  "IgnoreABI" "1"` line to `ServerFlags` section in Xorg config.

- Most Xorg drivers should run as-is (once recompiled!), with some exceptions.
  See `.gitlab-ci.yml` for the versions/branches built along with Xlibre.
